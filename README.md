# 🌍 Data Science & Visualization in R

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions using R. The goal is to identify top-emitting countries and visualize the data through bar plots.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- R Programming
- tidyverse
- ggplot2

## 📈 Process
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Visual analysis with ggplot2
- Plot saved to `/plots` folder

## 📊 Sample Plot
After running `analysis.R`, a plot will be saved in `plots/emissions_plot.png` showing the top 10 countries by CO₂ emissions.

## 📂 File Structure
- `analysis.R`: Core script
- `data/emissions.csv`: Dataset used
- `plots/`: Saved visualizations
